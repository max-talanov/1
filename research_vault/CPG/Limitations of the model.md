## Now currents speed is taken in account
these centres is provided by the persistent (slowly inactivating) sodium current (INaP)ineachneuron (known to be present in the rodent spinal neurons; see Zhong et al. 2007; Tazerart et al. 2008; Ziskind-Conhaim et al. 2008; Brocard et al. 2010, 2013)

## Single compartment models
All neurons were simulated in the Hodgkin–Huxley style as single-compartment models.

Each RG-F subpopulation in the model contained 100 neurons; each CIN population had 50 neurons.

## Distribution of parameters as random normal 

## Equal split of subpopulations 
Each RG-F centre is split into two equal subpopulations,

## Only spinal rats are taken in account
Though there is the difference between intact and spinal walking (Harnie, ..., Rybak; State-and condition ...) 

## The spinal cord after rehabilitation model (only)
Though there is significant difference in intact and spinal cat's walking 

## The no EES and afferent feedback modes taken in account 
Fictive locomotion (Kim, ..., Rybak Contribution of afferent)

## No muscle to RG model projections
(Kim, ..., Rybak; Contribution of afferent)

Such fictive locomotor preparations have been used to investigate the mechanism for the adaptive regulation of locomotor patterns by somatosensory afferent feedback. These studies have shown that stimulation of flexor and extensor sensory afferents can delay or advance flexion-to-extension or extension-to-flexion transitions depending on the timing of the afferent stimulation

## We use model of non-oscillating neurons


## No entering the hole modes taken in account although could be using CVs


## No II afferents in the model 
(Kim, ..., Rybak; Contribution of afferent)

It has been suggested that unloading of ankle extensor muscles and activation of the Ia and II sensory afferents from flexor muscles play an important role in the transition from stance to swing during normal walking in cats (Duysens and Pearson, 1980; Pearson et al., 1992; Hiebert et al., 1996).

## Limited number of modes (non-exhaustive)

In addition, animals change their gait patterns, such as walking, trotting, and galloping, depending on locomotor speed by controlling the interlimb coordination. A neural model simulating coordination between RG circuits controlling each limb has been proposed (Danner et al., 2016, 2017).

## No ascending projections taken in account diagonal or homolateral


## No cervical circuits taken in account

## No V3E projections in the model
