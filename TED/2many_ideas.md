## What problem did you have?

I had a problem and the problem was big and ubiquitous: I had too many ideas per day.
I have started blogging: https://cosmicdustman.wordpress.com/category/rd/ expressing the
ideas just in the internet space like radiating them. Then I have understood that radiating the ideas
have not make much sense without their implementation.
I needed some focus and that was the Machine Consciousness.

## What influenced you?

The book.

Around 2007 I have explored the book of Marvin Minsky "The emotion machine". That was fresh and unusual view on
the Artificial Intelligence(AI) and the emotions. For some historical reason we still perceive the machines
even the intelligent
ones as completely unemotional. This point of view is really common not only among non specialists in AI but also
among scientists. Machines are frequently associated with "pure" logic contrasted to emotional thinking. This was
the turning point of my life. Indeed we have cognition and consciousness working in our heads and nicely.

Let's have a look at the human brain and mind! Again.

To be honest the history of modern computing starts with high-level model of human brain implemented in
chips that what we know as Von Neumann architecture.

## What was the solution

When I turned 40 I have understood that there is no more time to waste if I want to do something interesting
I have to do this now. At this time I was SDA(Software design architect) and had some experience in some research
projects without any significant support from the company that made me to migrate all my research
activities to my open-source projects:
* [menta](https://code.google.com/p/menta/) - the project to automate simple software maintenance tasks.
* TU (thinking and understanding) - the project dedicated for the automation of incident processing in
infrastructure as service domain.
