## Imagination
When I was 12 years old my mind was enormously influenced by the stories of my grandpa
about the astrophysics.
Whole world expanded from building and streets to the galaxies and universe.
I still can remember the image of the trolleybus shrinking to the size of point of a needle.
This is the way I have discovered the power of imagination.

## Protest
Later when I was something like 20 and life during 90es in Russia was not easy, the ideas of
protest was really natural and easy to understand. I have started the musical punk rock group
Definitely
that was the hobby: we have not done much of music and much of poetry but managed to self express
our pain and social discomfort. Later I understood that it is not that important how different you
look, more important is how different you think, this simple idea triggered the interest in
the creative part of the programming in general and later in the AI.
Switching the perspective and using unconventional angles and approaches to look a scientific
problem is one of the powerful tools that I currently use.

## Bike and midlife crisis
At my 35-38 during midlife crisis I bought a bike, possibly this is not really original. I perceived it
as escape from the ordinary life and way to detach from the everyday routine.
Later I understood that powerful emotions as much dangerous as alcohol and this triggers my interest
to human emotions and their simulations.
