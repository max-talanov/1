#Introduction

##I was born in childhood

When I was 12 years old my mind was enormously influenced by the stories of my grandpa about the astrophysics.
Whole world expanded from building and streets to the galaxies and universe.
I still can remember the image of the trolleybus shrinking to the size of point of a needle.
This is the way I have discovered the power of imagination.

##Problem

I had a problem and the problem was big and ubiquitous: I had too many ideas per day.
I have started [blogging](https://cosmicdustman.wordpress.com/category/rd/) expressing the
ideas just in the internet space like radiating them. Then I have understood that radiating the ideas
have not make much sense without their implementation.
I needed some focus and that was the Machine Consciousness.

I have spent 8 years as engineer in one big company and they have had the problem.
Imagine one industrial company with something like 5000 employees, almost all of them have a computer
and someone had to maintain this infrastructure.
There are companies that provide the infrastructure
as service. Like the shoemaker's children go barefoot we can not do the automation of these frequently
primitive cases. My favorite is: "Please install new version of Firefox".
I have started what they call "On bench project" . After one year we have managed to demonstrate
some progress in the automation but still the system was:

* too fragile
* had redundant and stupid rules
* was unable of the self-development

So we had to use different approach.

##The book

Around 2007 I have explored the book of Marvin Minsky "The emotion machine". That was fresh and unusual view on
the Artificial Intelligence(AI) and the emotions. For some historical reason we still perceive the machines
even the intelligent
ones as completely unemotional. This point of view is really common not only among non specialists in AI but also
among scientists. Machines are frequently associated with "pure" logic contrasted to emotional thinking. This was
the turning point of my life. Indeed we have cognition and consciousness working in our heads and nicely.

Let's have a look at the human brain and mind! Again.

To be honest the history of modern computing starts with high-level model of human brain implemented in
chips that what we know as Von Neumann architecture.

##Solution

When I turned 40 I have understood that there is no more time to waste if I want to do something interesting
I have to do this now. At this time I was SDA(Software design architect) and had some experience in some research
projects without any significant support from the company that made me to migrate all my research
activities to my open-source projects:
* [menta](https://code.google.com/p/menta/) the project to automate simple software maintenance tasks.
* [TU](https://github.com/development-team/2) the project dedicated for the automation of incident processing in
infrastructure as service domain.

I have returned to the academia. At this point I got the understanding that the main reason of the
problems that we had: was absence of the understanding of what is human understanding (or cognition).

Now I do the research in machine consciousness that is mandatory part of the machine cognition and I'm the head of
the Machine Cognition lab in KFU(Kazan Federal University). There is group of scientists that work with me
including philosopher, neuro-scientist

One of our directions is simulation of the basic (inborn emotional reactions) in a machine .
We are doing computational neurobiology collaborating with neuroscientists 
There are group of scientists and we started the book about the machine consciousness mainly as the neural correlate
to several mental activities, in other words: explaining philosophical/psychological phenomena in neurobiological
terms.

##The TED speech

###Fear simulation

Recently we have received the preliminary results with simulation of fear in the machines.
Why fear, because currently it is the easiest way to simulate emotions in the machines.
Our research is in it's early
stage but already we have done some modeling and validation.
We even managed to simulate the fear in its simplest form
and indicate the connection of emotions and computational system parameters: computational power consumption,
learning and storage and we are able to indicate the moment when machine was in fear-like state.

Nick Bostrom in his [TED speech](http://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are) indicated the importance that super-intelligence "shares our(human) values". We completely agree
this position and more than that we propose that emotions and consciousness 
creates proper basement for the values system of future safe and friendly artificial intelligence or
super-intelligence.

###Machine consciousness 

Why consciousness is interesting and so complex/challenging?
Mainly because we do not understand the human consciousness, there are brilliant minds working on this problem:
[Daniel Dennett](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_dennett_on_our_consciousness), [David Chalmers](http://www.ted.com/talks/david_chalmers_how_do_you_explain_consciousness),
[Antonio Damasio](http://www.ted.com/talks/antonio_damasio_the_quest_to_understand_consciousness), [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emotion_Machine), Aaron Sloman ...

Currently we have a lot of machines that can do a lot of interesting and amazing things like IBM Watson. But still
there is no sign of the consciousness they still are unconsciously following the program that collective of
programmers
created. This is not that bad. But can we imagine the future with intelligent unconscious robots? With robots
that would help humans during their life having no emotions? No compassion, love?

I don't think so!

Recently I had speech on [TEDx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLvS7h3kRbo)
This speech is science popular interpretation of my position regarding machines and their consciousness.

We have to have conscious machines and capable of having emotional feelings not only the logic.

I'm pretty sure that if there was no crucial need for the consciousness and emotions then the evolution would get rid
of them. We want to create responsible and reasonable members of society
that will help us possibly already "old humans" in future.
