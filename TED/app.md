We take this portion of the application very seriously. Please take the time to answer the questions thoughtfully and with plenty of detail, to help us understand who you are.

All responses are limited to 1500 characters except where noted.

###List any awards, prizes or other Fellowships you have won, with the details below:

    The name of the award, prize or Fellowship
    The date it was received
    Any necessary context about the honor (e.g., "major math prize in Eastern Europe")

[Too many ideas](2many_ideas.md)

###How did you hear about the TED Fellows program? If you can, share the specific person, organization, etc.

###Have you participated in TED before? If so, to what extent? (e.g. you watch TED Talks, you’ve attended / hosted / spoken at a TEDx event, you’re a TED Translator, etc.)


List at least one website (more if you like!) that will help us understand you better.
Good examples include: your blog, your company's website, press coverage of your work, your portfolio, research examples, photos, etc. Less helpful are links to your Facebook or LinkedIn, but if you wish to share, make sure the profile is public.
