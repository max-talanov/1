# Fear simulation

Recently we have managed to simulate the fear in its simplest form
and indicate the connection of emotions and computational system parameters: computational power consumption,
learning and storage and we are able to indicate the moment when machine was in fear-like state.

Nick Bostrom in his TED speech indicated the importance that super-intelligence "shares our(human) values".
I completely agree with the position and more than that we propose that emotions and consciousness 
creates proper basement for the values system of future safe and friendly artificial intelligence or
super-intelligence.

# Machine consciousness

Currently we have a lot of machines that can do a lot of interesting and amazing things like IBM Watson. But still
there is no sign of the consciousness they still are unconsciously following the program that collective of
programmers
created. This is not that bad. But can we imagine the future with intelligent unconscious robots? With robots
that would help humans during their life having no emotions: no compassion, love?

I don't think so!

We have to have conscious machines and capable of having emotional feelings not only the logic.

I'm pretty sure that if there was no crucial need for the consciousness and emotions then the evolution would get rid
of them. We want to create responsible and reasonable members of society
that will help us possibly already "old humans" in future.
