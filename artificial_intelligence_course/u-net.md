# U-net

## Architecture 

The network architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. It consists of a contracting path (left side) and an expansive path (right side). The contracting path follows the typical architecture of a convolutional network. It consists of the repeated application of two 3x3 convolutions (unpadded convolutions), each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a 2x2 max pooling operation with stride 2 for downsampling.

At each downsampling step, feature channels are doubled. Every step in the expansive path consists of an upsampling of the feature map followed by a 2×2 convolution (up-convolution) that halves the number of feature channels, a concatenation with the correspondingly cropped feature map from the contracting path, and two 3×3 convolutions, each followed by a ReLU. The cropping is necessary due to the loss of border pixels in every convolution.

At the final layer, a 1×1 convolution is used to map each 64-component feature vector to the desired number of classes. In total the network has 23 convolutional layers.
