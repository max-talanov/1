# Intro

## Do we have AI?

## Why AI is so hard?

1. Biggest - we simply do not know what is natural intelligence.
1. Derivative: what is consciousness?
1. Derivative: what is thinking?
1. Derivative: what is emotion? 
1. Why do we need emotions? 
1. Does AI (robot) need emotion?
1. Are those questions above only philosophical?

## AI records 

1. Deep blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov.
1. 

## Some numbers

Biggest spiking NN built so far - [2013 RIKEN created NEST NN]((http://www.riken.jp/en/pr/press/2013/20130802_1)), according to the is report there were 1.7 billon of neurons with ... trillion of synapses. Is it big enough? 

Human brain(typical) contains [86 billion of neurons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_by_number_of_neurons).
Cats brain contains 1.5 billon neurons.
Monkeys (night monkey) cerebral cortex contains 1.7 billon of neurons.

Consider energy consumption! 
Do you think anyone could be interested in robot with power station?

## Good news

[IBM in the SyNAPSE project](http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/neurosynaptic-chips.shtml#fbid=f1HQ57tWR3E), developed a chip that emulated 256 neurons, now 1 million, based on new elements - memristors.
This year scientists from Stanford university developed [NeuroGrid](http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2014/pr-neurogrid-boahen-engineering-042814.html): the chip prototype that is capable of implementing the functions of one million of neurons and consumes 10 000 times less energy.
