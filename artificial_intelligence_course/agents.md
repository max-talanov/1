* **Inborn, Instinctive Reactions**: Joan hears a sound and turns her head. We are born with instincts that help us to survive.
* **Learned Reactions**: She sees a quickly oncoming car. Joan had to learn that certain conditions demand specific ways to react.
* **Deliberative Thinking**: What to say at the meeting. Joan considers several alternatives and tries to decide which would be best.
* **Reflective Thinking**: Joan reflects on her decision. Here she reacts not to external events but happenings inside her brain.
* **Self-Reflective Thinking**: Uneasy about arriving late. Here we find her thinking about plans that she has made for herself.
* **Self-Conscious Emotions**: What would my friends have thought of me? Here Joan asks how well her actions agreed with her ideals.
