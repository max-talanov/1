## [BRIAN](http://briansimulator.org/)

### Main features

1. **Models**: models are defined directly by their equations; threshold and reset (for integrate-and-fire models) can be customised. Both integrate-and-fire models and Hodgkin-Huxley type models can be used. Models with dendrites are possible, although it is not optimised for this case (in practice, Brian is still useful for models with a few compartments, but not with reconstructed dendritic trees).
Integration methods: exact integration for linear models, Euler, Runge-Kutta and exponential Euler for nonlinear models. Stochastic differential equations are also possible.
2. **Connectivity**: can be defined directly or with predefined functions (for all-to-all or random connectivity), and can include transmission delays.
3. **Units**: Brian has a system for defining quantities with physical dimensions. Arithmetical operations and equations are checked for dimensional consistency, which can help to eliminate hard to debug scaling errors and mistakes in entering equations.
4. **Control and monitoring**: all the internal variables of the simulator can be directly accessed to initialise the network or control it as it runs. Spikes and state variables can be monitored and either saved to a file or used directly. All monitors can be customised.
5. **Analysis and plotting**: any Python package can be used in combination with Brian, in particular the NumPy and SciPy scientific computing packages, and the PyLab graphics package which mirrors the syntax of the Matlab plotting commands. Brian also includes a number of functions for spike train statistics.
6. **Speed**: Brian uses vector-based operations (using NumPy and SciPy) to simulate neural populations very efficiently. For large networks, the cost of interpretation is small and the speed is comparable to C code.
7. **Plasticity**: short-term plasticity and spike-timing dependent plasticity.
8. **Distributed computing**: Brian can be used with the Parallel Python package to run independent simulations on a cluster or on different processors (e.g. running a simulation with different parameter values).
9. **Interfaces**: the CherryPy package can be used to write HTML interfaces to Brian simulations (running locally or on a web server). There are also a number of third-party packages available for graphic interfaces.

## [CARLsim: a GPU-accelerated SNN Simulator](http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~jkrichma/CARLsim/)

### Main features

CARLsim is an efficient C/C++-based Spiking Neural Network (SNN) simulator that allows execution on both generic x86 CPUs and standard off-the-shelf GPUs. The simulator provides a PyNN-like programming interface, which allows for details and parameters to be specified at the synapse, neuron, and network level. 
Currently CARLsim supports four-parameter Izhikevich spiking neurons in combination with current-based (CUBA) and conductance-based (COBA) synapses. Also, the simulator provides standard equations for (nearest-neighbor) spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), short-term plasticity (STP), and homeostatic synaptic scaling. CARLsim now includes a parameter tuning interface (PTI) library that utilizes evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to construct functional SNNs. 
CARLsim was originally written by Jayram Moorkanikara Nageswaran and Micah Richert. The code is now being maintained and extended by Michael Beyeler, Kristofor Carlson, and Ting-Shuo Chou. For a full list of contributors, see file AUTHORS in the code package.

## Catacomb

### Main features

1. **Component based modelling**. A model in Catacomb 3 is a collection of components that each does its own thing. Making a model involves connecting together existing components and making new components from templates by setting parameter values. You can also define new component types and specify their behavior.
2. **Workspace format**. Each component is stored in a separate file so it can be used in a variety of contexts. The workspace keeps track of all the available models and minimizes the tendency to duplicate models unnecessarily or to produce multiple slightly different versions of the same thing by accident. Combined graphical and textual model specification. Any model can be viewed and edited both as a tree of objects, parameters and values, and as components on a diagram. Sometimes one is better, sometimes the other.

3. **Flexible communication**. Catacomb 3 supports three styles of communication between components: event based, like spikes in axons, except the events can also carry values; continuous, where one component makes values available to others to be read whenever they are required; and physical where components are located in a physical space and interact by contact or various modes of action at a distance.

4. **Extensible model domain**. The biggest difference with Catacomb 2 is that you can now define your own components without delving into the source code. Just as you can build a model graphically, you can also build a component template that sets up the structures (parameter names and types etc) needed to model a particular class of object. To set the behavior, you can either link the component to an external code module or you can embed fragments of code in the component specification.

5. **Embedded scripting and code generation**. After you define a component by adding parameters or attaching access ports, the system can generate all the code needed to connect up and run the component. It presents you with a set of empty Java methods for all the things that can happen to the component (eg if you add an input port called spike of type "event", you get a method called "receive_spike()"). You simply fill out the method bodies to define the behavior and the system takes care of the rest.

6. **Physical model**. Any component can have a physical presence. You can add lines or shapes to set its size and appearance, and you can add subcomponents that use one of the physical modes of communication to make it interact with other physical components. This is how, for example, you add a whisker to a rat so that spikes are generated when it is touching a wall.

7. **Interfacing to existing software**. For small models, there are embedded scripts. For more complex models you can develop the code for the model independently and then use Catacomb 3 to set up user interface templates to set the input parameters and visualize the results. You can, of course, connect such externally defined models with other Catacomb components.

8. **Visualization and data export**. All data generated as a model runs is stored in tree matching the model structure and can be used later to define views for line graphs or other plots. Physical models give movies that play as the simulation is run and can be replayed at will afterwards.

9. **System independent model specification**. Models are saved as "vanilla" XML where the element and attribute names come from the component specification. Importantly, almost none of them are defined by the system (the exceptions are position, scale and visual representations for use in diagrams). This means the schema is under user control, not hardwired into the system, and it makes it much easier to adapt catacomb models to existing XML schemas.

## NCS

Our current NeoCortical Simulator (NCS) was developed in the Brain Computation Laboratory (University of Nevada, Reno) and shares similar approaches with well-known other simulators (e.g. GENESIS, NEURON), yet has its unique capabilities. NCS models integrate-and-fire neurons with conductance-based synapses.
NCS not only supports simulations for larger models, but also is the first simulator to support real-time neurorobotics applications.

### Main features

NCS5 models integrate-and-fire neurons with conductance-based synapses using two clusters: four SUN 4600 machines (16-processors each) connected via Infiniband with 192 GB RAM per machine, 24 Terabytes of disk storage; and 208 Opteron cores, 416 GB RAM, and more than a Terabyte of disk storage.

Experiments have demonstrated biologically realistic learning in real time by distributing models of 100,000 neurons over a cluster of 208 processors.

## [The Nengo Neural Simulator](http://www.nengo.ca/)

[Overview](http://nengo.ca/overview)

### Main features

To use Nengo, you define groups of neurons in terms of what they represent, and then form connections between neural groups in terms of what computation should be performed on those representations. Nengo then uses the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) to solve for the appropriate synaptic connection weights to achieve this desired computation. Nengo also supports various kinds of learning. Nengo helps make detailed spiking neuron models that implement complex high-level cognitive algorithms.

Among other things, Nengo has been used to implement motor control, visual attention, serial recall, action selection, working memory, attractor networks, inductive reasoning, path integration, and planning with problem solving (see the model archives and publications for details).

## [NSL](http://www.neuralsimulationlanguage.org/)

### Main features

NSL, Neural Simulation Language, is a simulation system for large-scale general neural networks. NSL provides a simulation environment simplifying the task of modeling neural networks. In particular, NSL supports neural models having as basic data structure neural layers with similar properties and similar connection patterns, where neurons are modeled as leaky integrators with connections subject to diverse learning rules. Development of NSL has gone hand in hand with modeling of neural mechanisms underlying visuomotor coordination, with special emphasis on the analysis of data from anurans, monkeys, and humans. NSL follows an object-oriented design, providing higher level programming abstraction corresponding to neural elements. NSL provides system development tools, such as visualization capabilities and a run-time interpreter, which give the user powerful tools in developing and analyzing models. NSL has been widely used throughout the world for both teaching and research.

## [ReMoto](http://remoto.leb.usp.br/remoto/index.html)

### Main features

ReMoto is a web-based neuronal simulation system, intended for studying spinal cord neuronal networks responsible for muscle control. These networks are affected by descending drive, afferent drive, and electrical nerve stimulation. The simulator may be used to investigate phenomena at several levels of organization, e.g., at the neuronal membrane level or at the whole muscle behavior level (e.g., muscle force generation). This versatility is due to the fact that each element (neurons, synapses, muscle fibers) has its own specific mathematical model, usually involving the action of voltage- or neurotransmitter-dependent ionic channels. The simulator should be helpful in activities such as interpretation of results obtained from neurophysiological experiments in humans or mammals, proposal of hypothesis or testing models or theories on neuronal dynamics or neuronal network processing, validation of experimental protocols, and teaching neurophysiology.

1. Connect these neuronal maps using projection files, and regroup common synaptic weights to save memory in order to be able to declare several hundreds of billions of synaptic connections.
1. Convert gray level images into lists of spikes (also SpikeNET can perform a variety of preprocessing on the input images).
1. Implement a complex mechanism for projection between neuronal maps of different sizes.
1. Implement supervised learning.
1. Implement the efficient neuronal Rank-Order-Coding scheme (optional)
1. SpikeNET does not have yet a comprehensive graphic interface. The neural network topology must be described using several configuration files (documented below).
1. SpikeNET has never been used to process more than one spike per neuron (SpikeNET was initially designed to test the biological plausibility of feed-forward processing using at most one spike per neuron). Note that it is still possible to implement lateral inhibition or excitation as well as feedback as long as neurons discharge only once.
1. SpikeNET can not implement synaptic connection with various delays. All synaptic connections are instantaneous

## [Topographica](http://ioam.github.io/topographica/)

## Main features

Topographica's main target audience is computational neuroscientists who want to simulate large, topographically mapped brain regions. Many such researchers initially start coding with general-purpose languages like Matlab or bare Python, because it is relatively straightforward to specify an initial fully-connected model with square connections and hard-coded sizes from scratch. However, as soon as the model becomes more complex, the code quickly becomes unwieldy. Supporting local rather than full connectivity, circular or arbitrary connection patterns rather than rectangular arrays, variable densities of neurons per region rather than hard-coded ones, arbitrary patterns of connectivity (including feedforward and feedback connections) between sheets rather than feedforward connections only, — all of these will quickly make code be unreadable and unmaintainable without a clear, clean overall design. Topographica’s developers have dealt with these cases already, and the result is highly robust and reliable, making it very straightforward to run a large class of models without complicated coding or debugging.

# HTM

![HTM](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/87/HTM_Hierarchy_example.png)

A typical HTM network is a tree-shaped hierarchy of levels that are composed of smaller elements called nodes or columns. A single level in the hierarchy is also called a region. Higher hierarchy levels often have fewer nodes and therefore less spacial resolvability. Higher hierarchy levels can reuse patterns learned at the lower levels by combining them to memorize more complex patterns.
