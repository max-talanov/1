#Cognitive approach to emotions articles analysis

##Interoceptive  inference,  emotion, and the  embodied  self

Crucially, none  identify  emotional  states  with  top-down  inference  of the  causes  of  interoceptive  signals,  as  argued  here  (and  as recently  taken  up  by  others  [9]).  Rather,  they  emphasize  a continuous,  dynamic,  but  largely  bottom-up  interoceptive representational  hierarchy  that  interacts  with  other perceptions  to  motivate  behaviour.  Perhaps  more  closely related  is  the  suggestion  that  the  AIC  is  involved  in  errorbased  learning  of  feeling  states  and  uncertainty  [15];  here, the  notion  of  ‘prediction  error’  is  expressed  in  terms  of change  detection  and  salience  rather  than  through  mechanisms  of  predictive  coding.

Suzuki  et  al.’s  results,  they  found  that  cardio-visual  synchrony  increased  identification  with  the  virtual  body,  again when  measured  both  objectively  and  subjectively.

### Conclusion

In  humans,  self-related  predictive  coding simultaneously  engages  multiple  levels  of  self-representation,  including  physiological  homeostasis,  physical  bodily integrity,  morphology  and  position,  and  –  more  speculatively  –  the  metacognitive  and  narrative  ‘I’.

For  example,  word recognition  memory  is  modulated  by  the  timing  of  visual stimuli  with  respect  to  cardiac  phase  under  restricted attention  [63].


### Interoceptive inference and psychology

Considering  interoceptive  inference  and  the  AIC  as  its  likely  brain basis  further  enhances the  explanatory  potential  of  this  framework  for psychopathology.  Links  between  perceptions  of  bodily  state  and emotional  and  neuropsychiatric  disorders  are  well  established.  For
example,  alexithymia  (broadly,  deficits  in  emotional  awareness)  is associated  with  failure  to  engage  AIC  [81]  and  with  degeneration  of AIC  and  of  VENs  (Box  2)  in  the  context  of  fronto-temporal  dementia [82,83].

##On the Role of Emotion in Embodied Cognitive Architectures: From Organisms to Robots

of a larger shift from the so-calledcomputer metaphor for mind and the view of cognition as mainly taking place ‘in the head’ toward theories and models ofembodied cognition that emphasize the interaction of agents and their environments [12, 13, 31, 61, 62, 73, 76, 86]. 

Damasio [19], on the other hand, identified what he called ‘‘the prevalent absence of a notion of organism in the sciences of mind and brain’’ as a problem, which he elaborated as follows: ‘‘It is not just that the mind remained linked to the brain in a rather equivocal relationship, but that the brain remained consistently separated from the body and thus not part of the deeply interwoven mesh of
body and brain that defines a complex living organism.’

For Freeman ‘‘humans and other animals maintain a stance of attention and expectation’’ [29, p. 97] and emotions are initiated in intentional dynamics. The hub of the emotional activation system lies in the self-organizing dynamics of a limbic space-time loop rather than predominantly in areas of sensory cortex. In this view, there is ‘‘[no] representation like a map, a look-up table, or a fixed memory store’’ [29, p. 103].
