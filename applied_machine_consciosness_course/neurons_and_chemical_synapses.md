## Types of neurons according to neurotransmitter

1. **Cholinergic neurons—acetylcholine**. Acetylcholine is released from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft. It acts as a ligand for both ligand-gated ion channels and metabotropic (GPCRs) muscarinic receptors. Nicotinic receptors, are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind nicotine. Ligand binding opens the channel causing influx of Na+ depolarization and **increases the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release**.
1. **GABAergic neurons—gamma aminobutyric acid**. GABA is one of two neuroinhibitors in the CNS, the other being Glycine. GABA has a homologous function to ACh, gating anion channels that allow Cl− ions to enter the post synaptic neuron. Cl− causes hyperpolarization within the neuron, **decreasing the probability of an action potential firing** as the voltage becomes more negative (recall that for an action potential to fire, a positive voltage threshold must be reached).
1. **Glutamatergic neurons—glutamate**. Glutamate is one of two primary **excitatory amino acids**, the other being Aspartate. Glutamate receptors are one of four categories, three of which are ligand-gated ion channels and one of which is a G-protein coupled receptor (often referred to as GPCR).
1. **Dopaminergic neurons—dopamine**. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that acts on D1 type (D1 and D5) Gs coupled receptors, which increase cAMP and PKA, and D2 type (D2, D3, and D4) receptors, which activate Gi-coupled receptors that decrease cAMP and PKA. Dopamine is connected to **mood and behavior**, and modulates both pre and post synaptic neurotransmission. Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra has been linked to Parkinson's disease.
1. **Serotonergic neurons—serotonin**. Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) can act as **excitatory or inhibitory**. Of the four 5-HT receptor classes, 3 are GPCR and 1 is ligand gated cation channel.  A lack of 5-HT at postsynaptic neurons has been linked to depression. Drugs that block the presynaptic serotonin transporter are used for treatment, such as Prozac and Zoloft.

"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a common subject in biological experiments, has around 100,000 neurons and exhibits many complex behaviors. Many properties of neurons, from the type of neurotransmitters used to ion channel composition, are maintained across species, allowing scientists to study processes occurring in more complex organisms in much simpler experimental systems."

### Signaling in chemical synapses

* The process begins with a wave of electrochemical excitation called an action potential traveling along the membrane of the presynaptic cell, until it reaches the synapse.
* The electrical depolarization of the membrane at the synapse causes channels to open that are permeable to calcium ions.
* Calcium ions flow through the presynaptic membrane, rapidly increasing the calcium concentration in the interior.
* The high calcium concentration activates a set of calcium-sensitive proteins attached to Synaptic vesicles that contain a neurotransmitter chemical.
* These proteins change shape, causing the membranes of some "docked" vesicles to fuse with the membrane of the presynaptic cell, thereby opening the vesicles and dumping their neurotransmitter contents into the synaptic cleft, the narrow space between the membranes of the pre- and postsynaptic cells.
* The neurotransmitter diffuses within the cleft.  Some of it escapes, but some of it binds to chemical receptor molecules located on the membrane of the postsynaptic cell.
* The binding of neurotransmitter causes the receptor molecule to be ''activated'' in some way.  Several types of activation are possible, as described in more detail below.  In any case, this is the key step by which the synaptic process affects the behavior of the postsynaptic cell.
* Due to thermal vibration, neurotransmitter molecules eventually break loose from the receptors and drift away.
* The neurotransmitter is either reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell, and then repackaged for future release, or else it is broken down metabolically.

### Synaptic plasticity

#### Homosynaptic plasticity

"Homosynaptic Plasticity (or also homotropic modulation) is a change in the synaptic strength that results from the history of activity at a particular synapse. This can result from changes in presynaptic calcium as well as feedback onto presynaptic receptors, i.e. a form of autocrine signaling. Homosynaptic plasticity can affect the number and replenishment rate of vesicles or it can affect the relationship between calcium and vesicle release. Homosynaptic plasticity can also be postsynaptic in nature. It can result in either an increase or decrease in synaptic strength."

#### Heterosynaptic plasticity

"Heterosynaptic Plasticity (or also heterotropic modulation) is a change in synaptic strength that results from the activity of other neurons. Again, the plasticity can alter the number of vesicles or their replenishment rate or the relationship between calcium and vesicle release. Additionally, it could directly affect calcium influx. Heterosynaptic plasticity can also be postsynaptic in nature, affecting receptor sensitivity."

## Electrical Synapse

![Electrical synapse](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Gap_cell_junction-en.svg)

"An electrical synapse is an electrically conductive link between two abutting neurons that is formed at a narrow gap between the pre- and postsynaptic cells, known as a gap junction. At gap junctions, cells approach within about 3.5 nm of each other, rather than the 20 to 40 nm distance that separates cells at chemical synapses. As opposed to chemical synapses, the postsynaptic potential in electrical synapses is not caused by the opening of ion channels by chemical transmitters, but rather by direct electrical coupling between both neurons. Electrical synapses are faster than chemical synapses. Electrical synapses are found throughout the nervous system, including in the retina, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the neocortex, and in the hippocampus."

"The synaptic delay for a chemical synapse is typically about 2 ms, whereas the synaptic delay for an electrical synapse may be about 0.2 ms."
