## Metafor

2006: I have hit the article of Henry Liberman and Hugo Liu: "Feasibility studies for programming in natural languages". It was the description of an approach to generate the code on Python based on Natural language description (English), it was implemented in "Metafor":

![Metafor metaphor](metafor.png)

###Example of processing with Metafor:

**(4) When a customer orders a drink, the bartender tries to make it. When the bartender is asked to make a drink, he makes it and gives it to the customer only if the drink is in the menu's drinks; otherwise, the bartender says "sorry i don't know how to make that drink" to the customer.**

```
class bar:
    the_bartender = bartender()
    the_menu = menu()
class bartender:
    def make(drink):
        if (drink in menu.drinks):
            bartender.make(drink)
            bartender.give(drink, customer)
    	else:
            bartender.say("sorry i don't know how to make that drink", customer)
    def give(drink, to_customer): pass
    def say(quote, to_customer): pass
class menu:
    drinks = [ sour_apple_martini, margarita, rum_and_coke ]
class drink: pass
class apple_martini(drink):
    properties = [“sour”,“sweet”]
class margarita(drink):
    properties = [“sweet”]
class rum_and_coke(drink):
    properties = [“bitter”]
class customer:
    def order(drink):
        bartender.make(drink)
```

## Issues

1. System is too fragile.
1. Not capable of the adaptation to the real life.
1. Not capable of thinking ...
1. Too many stupid rules.

##Machine cognition

**Machine cognition (understanding) <- Machine consciousness <- Machine emotions (affective computations)**

##Method

![Theoretical approach](layers_binding.png)

##Domains correlations

![P^3 Anthropocentric domains](p3_human.png)

##New domains

![Tree new domains](p3_model.png)

##Artificial living systems

1. Intellect is side effect of artificial living NN
1. Artificial living objects:
    2. SCOOP in Eiffel (Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming)
	2. Agents in Scala and Clojure

**Life means feeding and reproduction.**

##Functional vs Holistic methods

![Brodmann area](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/1307_Brodmann_Areas.jpg)

**Imagine 1 neuron -> cortical column ~ 10 000 neurons -> Brodmann area (V1) 140 million -> Cortex 19 - 23 billions -> Whole brain 86 billions (10^14–10^15 Synapses)**

## Possible applications

1. Computer games
1. Intellectual assistant capable of emotional dialogs and thinking
1. Automatic interviewers
1. Estimating human responses in the interest of manipulating it
1. Simulations of large social groups
1. Call centre automation
1. Software and hardware support automation
1. Virtual friends
1. Nursing software
1. Applications in emotional robots

## Sanity testing

### Recurrent NN

![Recurrent experiment schema](rnn.png)

The neuromodulation is simulated in primitive way: propagating the output of exit neuron to intermediate layer to 50 percent of neurons (determined randomly).

Training set:

* 1, 2: [0 - 100] and 3, 4: [100 - 255] = 2
* 1, 2: [100 - 255] and 3, 4: [0 - 100] = 1

### Results

### Spiking NN

![Basal ganglia connectivity diagram](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Basal-ganglia-classic.png)

Connectivity diagram showing excitatory glutamatergic pathways as red, inhibitory GABAergic pathways as blue, and modulatory dopaminergic pathways as magenta. (Abbreviations: GPe: globus pallidus external; GPi: globus pallidus internal; STN: subthalamic nucleus; SNc: substantia nigra compacta; SNr: substantia nigra reticulata)

The antagonistic functions of the direct and indirect pathways are modulated by the **substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc)**, which produces **dopamine**. In the presence of dopamine, D1-receptors in the basal ganglia stimulate the GABAergic neurons, favoring the direct pathway, and thus increasing movement. The GABAergic neurons of the indirect pathway are stimulated by excitatory neurotransmitters acetylcholine and glutamate. This sets off the indirect pathway that ultimately results in inhibition of upper motor neurons, and less movement. In the presence of dopamine, D2-receptors in the basal ganglia inhibit these GABAergic neurons, which reduces the indirect pathways inhibitory effect. **Dopamine therefore increases the excitatory effect of the direct pathway (causing movement) and reduces the inhibitory effect of the indirect pathway (preventing full inhibition of movement)**. 

This way we simulate:

1. Cortex
1. Striatum
1. GPe: globus pallidus external
1. GPi: globus pallidus internal 
1. STN: subthalamic nucleus
1. SNc: substantia nigra compacta
1. SNr: substantia nigra reticulata

With two main pathways:

**Direct pathway**

**Cortex** (stimulates) -> **Striatum** (inhibits) -> **"SNr-GPi" complex** (less inhibition of thalamus) -> **Thalamus** (stimulates) -> **Cortex** (stimulates) -> **Muscles, etc.**

**Indirect pathway**

**Cortex** (stimulates) -> **Striatum** (inhibits) -> **GPe** (less inhibition of STN) ->**STN** (stimulates) -> **"SNr-GPi" complex** (inhibits) -> **Thalamus** (is stimulating less) -> **Cortex** (is stimulating less) -> Muscles, etc.

Neuromodulation is implemented by SNc via production of the **dopamine** that influences Striatum triggering direct or indirect pathway.
