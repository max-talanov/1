# Projects

## Plan

1. NeuCogAr
1. Robot Dream

## NeuCogAr

Neuromodulating Cognitive Architecture

### Assumption

**Machine cognition (understanding) <- Machine consciousness <- Machine emotions (affective computations)**

### Problem: How do we make machine feel an emotion?

3 perspectives:

1. Philosophical
1. Psychological
1. Neurobiological

### Idea: Monoamines model

**Noradrenaline** influences overall speed of thinking process, **dopamine** and **serotonin** - reward processing and learning.

![Computing system parameters mapping](figure3_cube_of_parameters_front.png)

 1. Generic:
   2. Computing power load: dopamine, serotonin
   2. Computing power redistribution: noradrenaline
   2. Memory distribution (attention): noradrenaline
   2. Learning: serotonin, dopamine
   2. Storage: serotonin, dopamine
 1. Decision making/reward processing:
   2. Confidence: serotonin
   2. Satisfaction: serotonin
   2. Motivation, wanting: dopamine
   2. Risky choices inclination: noradrenaline
   2. Number of options to process: noradrenaline

#### Generic:

1. *Computing power load* overall load of the computational system is influenced by dopamine and serotonin: dopamine makes the cortex fire spikes more actively, serotonin makes the cortex fire spikes less actively.
1. *Computing power distribution*(computing processes distribution or load balancing) is influenced by noradrenaline the higher is noradrenaline more computing processes should be concentrated on current activity.
1. *Working memory(short term)* distribution is influenced by noradrenaline as neurotransmitter regulating attention.
1. *Learning* is impacted by serotonin and dopamine: dopamine plays major role in activation of previously remembered patterns and serotonin in pattern generation.
1. *Storage* management (long term memory) is influenced both by serotonin and dopamine, higher concentrations of both neurotransmitters the better action is remembered(less probability to forget).

#### Decision making:

1. *Confidence and satisfaction* of the system is directly influenced by serotonin higher serotonin more confident is the system.
1. System is more *motivated* under influence of dopamine.
1. System tends to choose *risky* actions under impact of noradrenaline.
1. Noradrenaline makes system use less *number of options* in width and depth to be processed during reasoning.

## Robot dream

The integration of a spiking neural network with real-time robotic system

### Problem

### Robot performance


-   **AR-601**: Intel Core i7-4700EQ; 8 GB;

-   **REEM-C**: Intel Core i7 2710QE x 2;

-   **Nao**: Intel Atom @ 1.6 GHz;

-   **iCub**: Intel® Core™2 Duo; 2 GB;

### Required performance

**RIKEN** 2013: 1% of human brain - 250 K-supercomputers (96
computing nodes, 2.0 GHz 8-core SPARC64; 16 GB of memory), slower than
human brain in 1000 times.

**Human brain project**: a whole human brain – 10 exaflop.

### Idea

#### Wake and dream

![Robot dream](robot-dream.png)


1.  A robotic system transfers the accumulated experience into the
    “Sleeping brain”.
2.  Processing:
    1.  The accumulated experience is transferred from a robotic system
        to the “Sleeping brain”;
    2.  Simulation starts producing a set of updated rules;
3.  The updated rules of the “Sleeping brain” are transferred to the
    robotic system and applied to it.
4.  The robotic system continues it’s job running updated with adjusted
    emotional reactions and accumulating new experience to be processed
    again starting from **A**.

## Conformity with Picard criteria

Rosalind Picard in her article "What does it mean for a computer to "have" emotions?" (2001) suggested following criteria to measure emotional capabilities of a computing system:

1. **Emotional** appearance is not discussed in this work.
1. **Multi-level emotion cognition and behavior generation** was demonstrated as complex dopamine pathway multi-subsystem processing of "fear-like" state.
1. **Emotional experience** is complex that consists of: "cognitive or semantic label; physiological changes; subjective feeling, intuition" we have scratch the surface and suggested psychological changes mechanism according to Lövheim model and subjective emotions perceptions.
1. **Mind-body interactions** consists of: "conscious and non-conscious events; regulatory and signaling mechanisms; biasing mechanisms, intuition; physiological and biochemical changes; sentic modulation, lying impacts pressure; waveform of love; smiles induce joy..." this partly could be implemented by presented model. Psychological and biochemical changes where presented.
