	abstract = {The effect of inhibitory management is usually underestimated in artificial control systems, using biological analogy. According to our hypothesis, the muscle hypertonus could be effectively compensated via stimulation by bio-plausible patterns. We proposed an approach for the compensatory stimulation device as implementation of previously presented architecture of the neurointerface, where (1) the neuroport is implemented as a DAC and stimulator, (2) neuroterminal is used for neurosimulation of a set of oscillator motifs on one-board computer. In the set of experiments with five volunteers, we measured the efficacy of motor neuron inhibition via the antagonist muscle or nerve stimulation registering muscle force with and without antagonist stimulation. For the agonist activation, we used both voluntary activity and electrical stimulation. In the case of stimulation of both the agonist and the antagonist muscles and nerves, we experimented with delays between muscle stimulation in the range of 0–20 ms. We registered the subjective discomfort rate. We did not identify any significant difference between the antagonist muscle and nerve stimulation in both voluntary activity and electrical stimulation of cases showing agonist activity. We determined the most effective delay between the stimulation of the agonist and the antagonist muscles and nerves as 10–20 ms.},

	abstract = {Existing methods of neurorehabilitation include invasive or non-invasive stimulators that are usually simple digital generators with manually set parameters like pulse width, period, burst duration, and frequency of stimulation series. An obvious lack of adaptation capability of stimulators, as well as poor biocompatibility and high power consumption of prosthetic devices, highlights the need for medical usage of neuromorphic systems including memristive devices. The latter are electrical devices providing a wide range of complex synaptic functionality within a single element. In this study, we propose the memristive schematic capable of self-learning according to bio-plausible spike-timing-dependant plasticity to organize the electrical activity of the walking pattern generated by the central pattern generator.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present the validation of the three-dimensional model of emotions by Hugo L{\"o}vheim the ``cube of emotion'' via neurosimulation in the NEST. We also present the extension of original ``cube of emotion'' with the bridge to computational processes parameters. The neurosimulation is done via re-implementation of DA, 5HT and NA subsystems of a rat brain to replicate 8 basic psycho-emotional states according to the ``cube of emotion''. Results of neurosimulations indicate the incremental influence of DA and NA over computational resources of a psycho-emotional state while 5-HT decreases the computational resources used to calculate a psycho-emotional state. This way we indicate the feasibility of the bio-plausible re-implementation of psychoemotional states in a computational system. This approach could be useful extension of decision making and load balancing components of modern artificial agents as well as intelligent robotic systems.},
